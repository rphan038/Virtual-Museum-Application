PROJECT DESCRIPTION

Upon running the program, a login screen will show up. The system has three different privelege levels of users. Admin can remove/add comments, remove/add users, and add museum pages. Curators can add museum pages and comment. Viewers can comment. Login information for each account level follows:

Admin
Username: Jack Black
Password: password1234

Curator
Username: Will Ferrell
Password: 0

Viewer
Username: student
Password: student

If the user is a new user, they can create a new account. However, they must have knowledge of the authentication PIN, which is obtained by asking the Admin outside of the system. The Admin can change this PIN but the PIN must start with C or V indicating the addition of a Curator and Viewer respectively.

Current authentication PIN: V200
